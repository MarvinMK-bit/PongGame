requirements:
python,
pygame,
internet connection.

Player 1 should run server.py, then client.py.
Once player 2 runs client.py as well, the game begins.
this works well with different connections. 

Otherwise using the same ipv4 address, Player 1 should run server_2.py, then client_2.py.
Once player 2 runs client_2.py as well, the game begins.
